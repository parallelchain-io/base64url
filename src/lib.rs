//! Implementation of the encode and decode operations (as defined in IETF RFC 4648) on a type [Base64URL].
//! Base64URL are Strings restricted to containing the 2^6 UTF-8 code points without padding.
//! It is the *only* binary-to-text encoding scheme used in ParallelChain F. 
//! 
//! In general, we use `-` and `_` instead of `+` and `/`, without paddings.
